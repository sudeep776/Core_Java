1) Why do we need interface
Interface -   something helps which help 2 system to interact with each other
              Helps achieve abstraction

Multiple inheritance and provides abstraction

2)Defining interface
Only public and default modifiers can be used. Protected and private are not allowed.

3) Methods in interface
All methods in interfaces are implicitly public
Methods cant be final

Fields are public static and final


4) Implementing interface
Overriding method cannot have restrict accesss specifiers
Conrete class must override al methods of interface
Abstract classes are not forced to override all methods
A class can implement multiple interfaces



5) Nested interface
Nested interface declared within an interface must be public
Nested interface devlared within a class can have access modifiers

interface.subinterface

6)Interface vs Abstract class

Functional interface and Lambda expression

Functional interface - 1 abstract method

Types of functional interface - consumer , producer , predicate and supplier

Consumer - accepts a single input parameter returns no result

Supplier - accepts no input parameter but produces a result

Function - accepts one argument
